A repo housing the project material for the pediatric heart signals project undertaken for computer vision lab.

Contains the final lab submission notebook as well as the development and testing notebook for this project.

The project involves classifying pediatric heart signals as normal or abnormal, a critical problem to be solved in prediction of heart issues in young children.
The models developed predict the likelihood of the given heart sound signal being abnormal. Before input to the model, audio signals are truncated and preprocessed using a discrete wavelet transform.
